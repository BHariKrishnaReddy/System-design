* Understanding UML Class Diagrams
  
  Class Diagrams represent classes with boxes divided into sections for class name, properties, and operations.
Properties correspond to member variables in Java, while operations relate to methods, allowing for a clear representation of the design.

* Converting Between Diagrams and Code
  
  Class Diagrams can be easily translated into Java code, with class names, properties, and operations directly mapping to Java constructs.
The process of converting code back to Class Diagrams is also straightforward, helping to visualize the design effectively.

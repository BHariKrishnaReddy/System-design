What is a Design pattern?

A design pattern in software development is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into code, but rather a template or guideline that can be adapted to solve specific design issues.

Key Characteristics:
* Proven Solutions: Design patterns are based on best practices and have been tested in real-world applications.
* Categories: They are typically categorized into three types:
  * Creational Patterns: Deal with object creation mechanisms (e.g., Singleton, Factory).
  * Structural Patterns: Focus on how objects and classes are composed to form larger structures (e.g., Adapter, Composite).
  * Behavioral Patterns: Concerned with the interaction and responsibility between objects (e.g., Observer, Strategy).
Using design patterns helps developers create more maintainable, flexible, and scalable software systems.
